The Citi Bike Program is a bike-sharing system in New York City. Cyclists can rent a bicycle from one of many stations around the city and return it to any other station. Citi Bike has released ridership information to the public. This contains a list of all rides taken, their start and end locations, their start and end times, and limited demographic information about the rider. Zip files containing the data for each month are available at https://s3.amazonaws.com/tripdata/index.html. We will be considering the data from 2015 only.
